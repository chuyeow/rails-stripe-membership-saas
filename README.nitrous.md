# Getting Started on Nitrous.IO

Hi! This is a fully-functional development environment with Ruby and RVM
pre-installed.

We've downloaded the rails-stripe-membership-saas example Rails application here, so go on to
the [README.textile](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-stripe-membership-saas/blob/master/README.textile)
and follow the instructions there to get the app up and running.

Once you've got the app running, go to "Preview" in the IDE menu and select
"Port 3000" to preview it.
